# PacMenExercise
This a simple game in which a pacman is created on demand and moves across the screen at a random velocity.
# How to Run
Click "Add PacMan" to add a new pacman to a random position on the screen. Click "Start Game" to move the pacman (or pacmen) across the screen at a random velocity.
# Roadmap of Future Improvements
To improve this game, collision could be added between the pacmen themselves. This way, the pacmen would no longer change directions only at the edges of the screen. A way to determine a "winner" of the game using a "last-man-standing" design could also be implemented in the future.
